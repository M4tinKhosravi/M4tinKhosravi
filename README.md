<h1>My Projects</h1>
<h2>Shifchin</h2>

<br>It can arrange the shifts in order to optimize the rest days, consider the preferred off days of the personelle, and distribute the shift days, equally.

<br><u>01-08-2022:</u>
<br>- The core is completed.


<h2>Basic Online School</h2>
<p><i>
Basic online school was my first experience of designing an online learning platform.
</i></p>
<p>
After lockdowns due to Covid-19 pandemic, I faced serious problem in managing my school classes. So I started to design my own online class.

With Basic Online School you can define multiple students and assign them to classes. You may upload and share custom materials with each class and ask your students to upload homework files for each material (due dates are supported!)
You may also run multiple-choice exams for each class, too.

The Basic Online School was intended to be managed by myself so I did not put effort to design its admin page!
The project is discontinued due to the reopening of the schools ^__^
